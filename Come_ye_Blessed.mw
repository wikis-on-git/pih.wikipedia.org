Then shall the King

Say unto them

On his right hand:

Come ye blessed of my Father

Inherit the kingdom prepared for you

From the foundation of the world

I was hungerâ€™d and ye gave me meat,

I was thirsty and ye gave me drink

I was a stranger and ye took me in,

Naked and ye clothed me,

I was sick and ye visited me,

I was in prison and ye came unto me

In as much ye have done it unto one of the least of

These my brethren

Ye have done it unto me,

Ye have done it unto me.
