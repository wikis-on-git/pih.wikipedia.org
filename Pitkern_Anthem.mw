==Words==

Then shall the King<br />
Say unto them<br />
On his right hand:<br />
Come ye blessed of my Father<br />
Inherit the kingdom prepared for you<br />
From the foundation of the world<br />
I was hungerd and ye gave me meat,<br />
I was thirsty and ye gave me drink<br />
I was a stranger and ye took me in,<br />
Naked and ye clothed me,<br />
I was sick and ye visited me,<br />
I was in prison and ye came unto me<br />
In as much ye have done it unto one of the least of<br />
These my brethren<br />
Ye have done it unto me,<br />
Ye have done it unto me.<br />
