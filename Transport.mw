MEXICO CONFERENCE FAILED IS OF COURSE

Habitat is disturbed seriously the threat of the survival of humanity

UN has mat to discuss several measures to rescue, but the meetings did not bring any results because the scientists were wrong in assessing the situation.

Say ing that the warming earth is a superficial awareness, lack of depth and reality of climate change in two opposite directions:

-The air heats up, everyone knows.
In the colder land, evidence of the snow storm and colder winters in recent years than ever before.

Environmental degradation is now not only due to climate changes, but more profound disturbance of the soil, and partly due to environmental pollution, environmental pollution science have said several, the rest of climate changes and disturbances in the soil, soil disturbance is the root element,

In climate change has two aspects:
Oxygen consumption.
Carbon dioxide emissions.
The creation of carbon dioxide emissions have three chains are:

Oil exploitation - oxygen consumption - carbon dioxide emissions.

Oil in particular.

Left between oxygen and carbon, oxygen is the root, carbon dioxide is tops.

Carbon dioxide used for research is wrong
That is the cause of the failure of the Conference of the United Nations environment, such as Copenhagen and Mexico.

Deep natural law, not all phenomena are direct, but not so that the arbitrary interpretation. Every theory must be clearly explained...

Science says "greenhouse effect", "ozone hole" is not logical by reasoning.

According to the theory of conservation of mass: matter in the universe is not self-generated nor lost, oxygen is material, it is not endless.


This planet is over 6 billion people consuming oxygen, livestock, industry and transportation, also consuming oxygen, causing the atmosphere of severe hypoxia.

Heat (gas-positive) solar energy, oxygen (negative) cooling of the earth,
imbalance of oxygen and solar heat, warming the atmosphere hence, not due to the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.
(see site asked environmental access instructions below).

Said climate change created all the natural disasters is wrong.
Climate change is only melt ice at the poles, thin mixture gas of life, mainly cause disease in humans, making lifestyle degradation, increasing social evils (see website).(which determine the sites).

Air temperature rises if they are distributed everywhere, nothing happens, 
it is a different threat, and the difference is from the earth..

Underground lava flow thermal conductivity of plant nutrition, as well as nurture people and animals. Keep the temperature of lava heat radiation, keeping the temperature stable in the soil.
Excessive exploitation of oil, it is no longer sufficient to contain the radiation heat of lava.

-The lack of oil to keep lava directly affects the earth's crust, making the hot springs, some cracks forming lava of volcanic eruptions, volcanic ocean born "El Nino" then "El Nina", Transform a whole extensive regional climate.

Heat makes cold air being pushed up the upper end, no compromise with water vapor, rain is not created, causing droughts, forest fires, desert.

Elsewhere steam concentrate rainfall caused flooding.

Lack of oil and create dry cracks big space, big landslide created the earthquake ...

Deforestations do not have enough trees to absorb carbon dioxide in the earth to produce oxygen.
Not only the deficit of oxygen in the atmosphere, but still lack need some heat in the soil, cold earth entrails go.

Volcanoes and volcanic oceans disrupt lava snuff-gourd. 
Lava is no longer enough to cover everywhere.
Where there is no lava to cold ground, many parts of the water of summer ice. Habitats on earth has been narrowed.

People consume more oxygen, while the stability of the sea, even marine capture fisheries, Sea decreased oxygen consumption,so the difference between air and sea. With differences in environmental earth adjustment:
Marine gas injection to compensate for the atmosphere ..

Normal sea breeze blowing 20-25 degree angle, when sprayed into the air it up to 40-45 above the ground. create a tropical low pressure, low pressure and monsoon usually combine to create turbulence, a chain reaction, the stronger the wind storm.

The cause of the harsh environment today is due to yin-yang imbalance in air temperature and changes in the ground.

Only cut carbon dioxide emissions can not improve the atmosphere,
Cut emissions of carbon dioxide have no program to create alternative energy sufficient to affect the economy, more harmful to humanity.

Must balance the atmosphere and biochemical stability in the ground with the actual synthesis methods, the program must be comprehensive in all the national and global.

But the planet is not a comprehensive agency leaders, the UN has many flaws in the frequency, organizational structure and functions. Therefore need to reform the United Nations comprehensive and thorough, fully competent and reputable leaders meet urgent needs of the current environment.
